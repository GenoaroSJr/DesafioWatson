# Challenge - Smarkio (Text to Speech)

## What is the Smarkio (Text to Speech) challenge?
The Challenge - Smarkio (Text to Speech) is a challenge proposed by the company Smarkio - Itajub√°, where the challenged must create an application using Node.js, MySql and Ajax. The application must receive a phrase, save it in the database, present it in the browser without reloading the page and, when clicking on a "listen" button, the IBM Text to Speech API must transform the chosen phrase into an audio.
